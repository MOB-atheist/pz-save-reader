# Import Path Guidelines

## Next.js App Directory Imports

- **Always use the correct base path for imports**
  - ✅ DO: Use `@/app/...` for files inside the app directory
  ```typescript
  import { TaskFormValues } from "@/app/types/form";
  ```
  - ❌ DON'T: Use incorrect base paths
  ```typescript
  // Wrong - this won't work in app directory
  import { TaskFormValues } from "@/types/form";
  ```

## shadcn/ui Component Imports

- **Always import shadcn components from root level**
  - ✅ DO: Use `@/components/ui/...` for shadcn components
  ```typescript
  import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
  import { Form } from "@/components/ui/form";
  ```
  - ❌ DON'T: Import from app directory
  ```typescript
  // Wrong - shadcn components are installed at root level
  import { Button } from "@/app/components/ui/button";
  ```

- **Check existing file structure before creating new paths**
  - Always search for existing files before creating new ones
  - Use `file_search` or `list_dir` to verify file locations
  - Pay attention to error messages about missing modules - they often indicate wrong paths

## Module Resolution

- **Handle circular dependencies**
  - Move shared types to a dedicated types directory
  - Use relative imports for closely related files
  - Consider creating a barrel file (index.ts) for commonly used types

- **Type imports**
  - Use `type` imports for type-only imports
  ```typescript
  import type { TaskFormValues } from "@/app/types/form";
  ```
  - Keep type definitions close to their primary usage

## Best Practices

- **Verify import paths work**
  - Test imports after adding new files
  - Check TypeScript errors for path issues
  - Use consistent import patterns within a directory

- **Module organization**
  - Keep related functionality together
  - Use barrel files for complex modules
  - Document module structure in comments

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Wrong base path in app directory**
   - Remember that `@/` maps to the root, so app directory files need `@/app/`
   - Check existing imports in the file for the correct pattern
   - Exception: shadcn components are always at root level (`@/components/ui/...`)

2. **Circular dependencies**
   - Watch for type imports creating cycles
   - Move shared types to a common location
   - Use interface merging when appropriate

3. **Missing type declarations**
   - Ensure types are exported properly
   - Check file extensions (.ts vs .tsx)
   - Verify tsconfig.json paths
